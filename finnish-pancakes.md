# "Finnish" Pancakes (aka Thundercakes)


> This is the defacto pancake of Northwestern Ontario, and specfically Thunder Bay. Finnish settlers were enticed to come to Canada to cut down trees and this style of pancake emerged from this working class. In truth Finland have many kinds of pancakes and this style of pancake is similar to Lettu. This pancake is thin, but thick enough that is much be flipped, its not crispy, but similar to a very wet cloth.

## Comments

Its important you add ingredients in the order listed otherwise your
final pancake will be different. For example if you add butter on the
last step it turns your pancakes yellow.

Its important that you come close to burning the butter when adding it
to the skillet, this givens the pancake an attractive pancake texture
and flavour.

If you pancake begins to bubble like a baloon that means you need to
turn down the heat.

Its important not to rush flipping the pancake, if you watch closely you
can see the pancake solidfying ontop. You can take your spatula and
touch the top of the pancake to see if the top of the pancake is sticky
or not, this can be good incidator for flipping

You might want to disengage your smoke dectector, or open windows and
have some clothes to fan your smoke dectector.

Watch your bacon! You might want to take your bacon out early, depends
if you use convention or not. With convection oven it half the time
so by your fourth pancake you are takig our your bacon.

Normally "Finnish Pancakes" are done in 12in skillet, but at this size
the pancakes are difficult to flip increase loss of pancake, so this
recipe is modified to be reasonable.

You don't have to chill your batter, its just an old pancake ritual.

You cannot substitute butter for margarine.
