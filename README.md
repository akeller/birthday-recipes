# Amara's Birthday Recipe Repo

This time last year I was able to celebrate my birthday outside of my home, including preparing for a conference trip that would be my last time traveling on a plane pre-COVID lockdowns. I know many of you have celebrated COVID birthdays, almost a year's worth of you at this point. The best birthday gift you can give to me is a PR with a recipe in it we can share with each other.

Do you have a signature dish? Do you have a favorite recipe? Maybe something you've learned or perfected in the past year? Please share it! 

## Rules

If you can see this, you are eligible for submitting a PR to this repo. You don't even have to be my friend, acquaintence, or coworker. Feel free to send a birthday wish in the PR.

Please do not post your family's secret recipe. This is the internet. I don't want anyone's grandparent or auntie or crazy uncle coming for me.

Give credit where credit is due - link to the inspiring recipe(s)!
